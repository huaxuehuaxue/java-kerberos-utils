# Java Kerberos Utilities

The aims of this project are to:
* Help make using kerberos in Java a little easier.
* Interpret kerberos tokens from Microsoft Active Directory to extract additional information available in the PAC
* A learning exercise for me

This is a very rough project with a desperate need for more tests and probably a fair chunk of refactoring.
